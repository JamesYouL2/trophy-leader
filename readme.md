Train an AI to draft Magic: the Gathering.

Notebooks contain data processing and modeling code along with sample results. In particular, see https://github.com/zswitten/trophy-leader/blob/master/DraftbotKeras-Flooey.ipynb for the best-performing model.

This repo doesn't include training data. You can use `scrape_draftsim` to get draft data from [Draftsim](http://draftsim.com), or inquire at [Flooey](https://magic.flooey.org/).
